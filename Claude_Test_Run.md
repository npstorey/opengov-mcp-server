I found the main 311 Service Requests dataset that contains all 311 complaints from 2010 to present, which is updated daily. This dataset includes fields for:

Complaint Type
Borough
Created Date
Descriptor (provides further detail on the complaint)
However, I notice that the NYC Open Data tools I have access to only allow me to search for and retrieve metadata about datasets, not query the actual data within them. To get the specific count of noise complaints in Brooklyn for June 2025, you would need to:

Visit the NYC Open Data portal directly at data.cityofnewyork.us
Access the "311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present" dataset (ID: erm2-nwe9)
Filter the data by:
Borough: "BROOKLYN"
Created Date: Between June 1, 2025 and June 30, 2025
Complaint Type: Various noise-related categories (like "Noise", "Noise - Residential", "Noise - Commercial", etc.)
The dataset is comprehensive and includes all 311 requests, so it will definitely have the noise complaint data you're looking for. You can also download the filtered data or use the NYC Open Data API to programmatically access this information.

Would you like me to search for any other NYC Open Data resources that might have pre-aggregated noise complaint statistics?
