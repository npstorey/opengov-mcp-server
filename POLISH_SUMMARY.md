# OpenGov MCP Server - Polish Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Session Callback Warning ✅
- Moved `onsessioninitialized` and `onsessionclosed` callbacks from instance assignment to constructor options
- This eliminates the warning "onsessioninitialized not found on transport" at line 231
- Both callbacks are now properly passed through to the SDK

### 2. Implemented prompts/list Handler ✅
- Added `ListPromptsRequestSchema` import from SDK types
- Created handler that returns an empty prompts array
- This eliminates the "Method not found" error (-32601) for prompts/list requests

### 3. Updated OpenAICompatibleTransport ✅
- Added proper handling for `onsessionclosed` callback
- Session cleanup now removes connection mappings when sessions close
- Both callbacks are properly chained to allow external telemetry

### 4. Expanded Test Coverage ✅
- Updated test sequence to: initialize → notifications/initialized → prompts/list → tools/list → GET
- Added explicit test for prompts/list returning empty array
- Verified no "Method not found" errors

### 5. Provided Build/Test Commands ✅
- Created `commands.md` with comprehensive instructions
- Included curl commands for manual testing
- Added automated test script for full OpenAI handshake
